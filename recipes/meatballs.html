    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <p>Make sure to seal the mozzarella cheese completely inside the meatball to prevent it from oozing out during cooking.</p>
    <p>For extra flavor, brown the meatballs in the skillet before simmering them in the marinara sauce.</p>
    <p>Use a cookie scoop or spoon to portion out the meat mixture evenly for uniform meatballs.</p>
